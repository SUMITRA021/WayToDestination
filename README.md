# WayToDestination

**An AR-based indoor navigation application that would direct users to their desired location inside the NMIT campus based on their current location using virtual arrows.**


### Motivation:
* GPS is not very helpful for navigating inside a particular place.
* People face difficulty in finding routes to the destination inside premises.


### Built with:
* Unity Hub
* Unity Editor
* C#

### Primary objectives are:
* To provide real time navigation based on camera and current location of the user devices. 
* To use AR based features to guide the user to the destination.
* To use NMIT maps and user’s current locations as a case study.

### Future goals:
* Expand navigation assistance to larger geographical areas.
* UI enhancement.
* Adding voice assistance.
* User interaction can be enhanced by enabling voice based inputs.


## How to use the Application:
1. Scan the QR code to install the application.
2. Select the destination from the given list.
3. Hold the phone camera facing the corridors.
4. Follow the AR path that appeared on the phone screen to reach the destination.
